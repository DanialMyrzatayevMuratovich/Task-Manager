# üìù Task Manager 
# ‚ú® Project Summary
This is a console-based task management application developed in Java. The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of core programming principles essential for a Back-end developer.
Key Focus: Implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), managing dynamic data using Java Collections, and handling data persistence via File I/O.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Concepts Demonstrated
Language:	Java SE (Core)	Core application logic and execution.
OOP:	Encapsulation	Used in the Task class to protect data integrity (ID, description, status).
Collections:	ArrayList & Comparator	Stores tasks dynamically and sorts them by priority.
Persistence:	File I/O	Saves and loads task data to a local .txt file for persistent storage.
Utility:	Scanner	Handles command-line user input.

# üîë Core Features
The system offers the following functionalities via the console interface:
Task Management (CRUD): Add new tasks with descriptions and priority levels (1-5).
Task Status: Mark tasks as completed.
Data Sorting: Displays tasks sorted automatically by Priority (highest first).
Persistence: Automatically loads saved tasks on startup and saves the current list upon exit, ensuring data integrity.
Basic Error Handling: Prevents common crash scenarios like invalid menu choices.
